Problem Set Description:
Create a simulation of a CPU.

Solution Description:
I created a CPU simulation that runs visually in pygame, but can be run without visuals. The CPU can be programmed manually by directly inserting instructions and data into ram, or it can be programmed via a text file in the programs directory then compiled using the compiler from compiler.py
